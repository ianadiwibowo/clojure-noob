# Clojure Noob

My personal cheat sheet when learning this weird language [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), along with its packaging system [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). Like, see this weird philosophy:

> It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures.
> â€”Alan Perlis
